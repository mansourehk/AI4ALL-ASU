    "## Learn More about Types of Data\n",
    "In machine learning, data is represented in a tabular format. Consider the example of predicting whether an individual who visits an online book seller is going to buy a specific book. This prediction can be performed by analyzing the individualâ€™s interests and previous purchase history. For instance, when John has spent a lot of money on the site, has bought similar\n",
    "books, and visits the site frequently, it is likely for John to buy that specific book. John is an example of an instance. Instances are also called points, data points, or observations. A dataset consists of one or more instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tb1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset is represented using a set of features, and an instance is represented using values assigned to these features. Features are also known as *measurements* or *attributes*. In the above example, the features are Name, Money Features, Measurements, or Attributes Spent, Bought Similar, and Visits; feature values for the first instance are John, High, Yes, and Frequently. Given the feature values for one instance, one tries to predict its class (or class attribute) value. In our example, the class attribute is Will Buy, and our class value prediction for first instance is Yes. An instance such as John in which the class attribute value is unknown is called an unlabeled instance. Similarly, a labeled instance is an instance in which the class attribute value in known. Mary in this Labeled and dataset represents a labeled instance. The class attribute is optional in a Unlabeled dataset and is only necessary for prediction or classification purposes. One can have a dataset in which no class attribute is present, such as a list of customers and their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of features based on the characteristics of the feature and the values they can take. For instance, Money Spent can be represented using numeric values, such as $25. In that case, we have a continuous feature, whereas in our example it is a discrete feature, which can take a number of ordered values: {High, Normal, Low}.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nominal (categorical)**. These features take values that are often represented as strings. For instance, a customerâ€™s name is a nominal feature. In general, a few statistics can be computed on nominal features. Examples are the chi-square statistic (Ï‡2) and the mode (most common feature value). For example, one can find the most common first name among customers. The only possible transformation on the data is comparison. For example, we can check whether our customerâ€™s name is John or not. Nominal feature values are often presented in a set format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordinal**. Ordinal features lay data on an ordinal scale. In other words, the feature values have an intrinsic order to them. In our example, Money Spent is an ordinal feature because a High value for Money Spent is more than a Low one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interval**. In interval features, in addition to their intrinsic ordering, differences are meaningful whereas ratios are meaningless. For interval features, addition and subtraction are allowed, whereas multiplications and division are not. Consider two time readings: 6:16 PM and 3:08 PM. The difference between these two time readings is meaningful (3 hours and 8 minutes); however, there is no meaning to $\\frac{6:16 PM}{3:08 PM} \\neq 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ratio**. Ratio features, as the name suggests, add the additional properties of multiplication and division. An individualâ€™s income is an example of a ratio feature where not only differences and additions are meaningful but ratios also have meaning (e.g., an individualâ€™s income can be twice as much as Johnâ€™s income).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
